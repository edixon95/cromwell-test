Choose your operating system and follow the on screen instructions if not installed already.

1. Clone the repo to your machine

2. Preparing the server
	- Navigate to cromwell.api/
	- open the .env
	- Find "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cromwell" and replace "mongodb://localhost:27017/cromwell" with your own mongoURI
	- Make sure you have a table named "users"

3. Running the server
	- Open cromwell.api in the terminal
	- type "npm install"
	- Once completed, type either "npm start" or "node server.js" 
	- You should expect two logs - "Database connected" and what port the server is running on (5000)
		- If you encounter an error, make sure you followed all the points in step 2, and that the mongo connection is running


3.5. Setting up the Website (If server is not running locally, or not on port 5000)
	- Navigate to cromwell.web/src/config/
	- Open .apiConfig.jsx
	- Find (near the top) "base_url: "http://localhost:5000", replace "http://localhost:5000" with your server address

4. Running the website
	- Open cromwell.web in the terminal (you may need a different terminal to what's running the server)
	- type "npm install"
	- Once completed, type "npm run dev"
	- You should expect a log of "Local: http://localhost:XXXX/"
	- Navigate to localhost to see the website
