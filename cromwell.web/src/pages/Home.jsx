                                While the Swiss Army Hammer boasts a dazzling array of interchangeable heads, grips, handles, and an utterly unnecessary Bluetooth syncing feature, we feel it is our ethical responsibility to inform users that - despite the grandeur of its name and the sleek anodized titanium accents - the Swiss Army Hammer is, at its core, a hammer.

                                It does not saw. It does not screw. It cannot open bottles, remove splinters, purify water, or charge your phone (anymore). It does not contain a flashlight, toothpick, corkscrew, compass, nor does it include any functionality that might traditionally be expected from a multitool, Swiss-made or otherwise.

                                In fact, of the 37 possible configurations, 36 are objectively less ergonomic than a standard hammer. But they do look cool.
